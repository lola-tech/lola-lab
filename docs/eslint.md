The current ESLint configuration is based on the following link: [ESLint Tutorial](https://dev.to/jonasmerlin/automatically-lint-format-your-code-on-commit-when-using-next-js-3p6g)

⛔️Commits with ```console.log``` or ```debugger``` are not allowed.
If you really need them for some reason you can force it by adding ```--no-verify``` at the end of your commit
